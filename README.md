# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Ensemble
This project applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series forecasting of stock prices, using historical financial data from Yahoo Finance. Multiple deep learning models were trained to capture temporal dependencies, and their predictions were further enhanced through ensemble methods (stacking and averaging) for improved accuracy and robustness.

**Key Features:**
1. Data collection and preprocessing from Yahoo Finance API.
2. Stock price forecasting using LSTM-based models.
3. Ensemble learning (stacking, averaging) for performance improvement.
4. Comparative analysis of individual vs ensemble predictions.
5. Visualization of actual vs predicted stock trends.
